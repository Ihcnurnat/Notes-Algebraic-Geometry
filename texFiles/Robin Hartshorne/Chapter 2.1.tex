\section{Example 1.0.3.}

See some examples of presheaves that are not sheaves \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics)}{HERE}; a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/195363/constant-presheaf-not-necessarily-a-sheaf-proof}{HERE}.

In Wiki's page \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics)}{HERE}, it introduced non-separated presheaf, i.e. presheaf that doesn't satisfy locality axiom for sheaf.
