For equivalent definitions, see Wiki \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_component}{HERE};
Also see "dense" on Wiki \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set}{HERE}.

See Atiyah's \cite{atiyah1994introduction} Exercise 19 from Chapter 1 for more information...

See Lemma 14. on Page 210 of \cite{bosch2013algebraic} for equivalent characterisations of \textit{irreducible}.

\section{Example 1.1.3.}
See Atiyah's \cite{atiyah1994introduction} Exercise 19 from Chapter 1, which proves it must be dense.

For the sake of contradiction, assume a non-empty subset $A\subset X$ is reducible. Hence there exist two proper closed subset $A_1,A_2\subset A$ such that $A=A_1\cup A_2$.
Then we have $$X=(A^c\cup A_1)\cup (A^c\cup A_2),$$ which implies $X$ is reducible. \todo{\ding{53}!}

See a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/460074/an-open-subset-of-an-irreducible-set-is-dense}{HERE} \todo{\ding{52}}

First approach applied some density argument. While the second approach, similarly, gave a decomposition of the whole space given the open set is reducible.

\section{Example 1.1.4.}

\section{Prop 1.2 (d)}

According to Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, I agree we'll get $I(Z(\mathfrak a))\subset \sqrt{\mathfrak a}$.
For the reverse inclusion, pick any $f\in A$ such that $f^r\in\mathfrak a$ where $r\in\mathbb Z_{>0}$. We wish to show that $f(P)=0$ for any $P\in Z(\mathfrak a)$. By definition, $f^r(P)=0$ given $f^r\in\mathfrak a$. And this implies $$f^r(P)=(f(P))^r=0 ~\Rightarrow~ f(P)=0$$ given the polynomial ring $A$ is an integral domain. Therefore we get the inclusion 
$$I(Z(\mathfrak a))\supset \sqrt{\mathfrak a}.$$

See Theorem 6 on Page 183, Strong Nullstellensatz, \cite{cox2013ideals}. \todo{\ding{52}}

\section{Proposition 1.10.}

\section{Exercise 1.1.}

\subsection{(a)}

By definition of affine coordinate ring we have 
\[A(Y)=A/I(Y)=A/I(Z(f))=A/\sqrt{\langle f\rangle}.\]
While $f$ is irreducible in U.F.D. $k[x,y]$, the ideal it generated will be a prime ideal, which is radical. Therefore we can further simplify the expression as 
\[A/\sqrt{\langle f\rangle}=A/\langle f\rangle=k[x,y]/\langle y-x^2\rangle=k[x].\]
Hence we can conclude $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.

\subsection{(b)}

\section{Exericse 1.2.}

My initial guess was incorrect, in which I thought $I(Y)=\langle z-xy\rangle$.

\subsection{Solutions}

See a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3137828/proving-y-x2-z-xy-generate-the-ideal-of-the-twisted-cubic}{HERE}, and \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/568528/the-twisted-cubic-is-an-affine-variety}{HERE}.

See a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1864637/the-affine-coordinate-ring-of-twisted-cubic-curve-y-is-ay-kx-y-z-z-x3}{HERE}.

The correct one is $I(Y)=\langle z-x^3,~ z-y^2\rangle$.
Notice that \[\operatorname{dim}Y=\operatorname{dim}A(Y)=\operatorname{dim}k[x,y,z]/\langle z-x^3,~ z-y^2\rangle=\operatorname{dim}k[z]=\operatorname{tr.deg}_k k(z)=1.\]
Therefore we proved that $A(Y)$ is isomorphic to a polynomial ring in one variable over $k$.

Question: How to compute $I(\cdot)$ precisely?

\section{Exercise 1.4.}

See a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/128102/why-is-the-zariski-topology-on-bbb-a2-not-the-product-topology-on-bbb-a1}{HERE}, \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2119539/proving-that-the-zariski-topology-in-mathbba2-is-not-the-product-topology}{HERE},
and \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1607060/show-that-the-zariski-topology-on-a2-is-not-the-product-topology-on-a1-tim}{HERE}.

The hint was to consider diagonal. Let the coordinate ring of $\mathbb A^2$ be $A(\mathbb A^2)=k[x,y]$ where $k$ is algebraically closed. 
Then the diagonal \[\Delta =\{(x,y)\in\mathbb A^2 ~\mid~ x=y\}= Z(x-y=0)\] is closed in Zariski topology of $\mathbb A^2$.

But it cannot be countably many union of closed subsets in product topology of copies of Zariski topology on $\mathbb A^1$, which are finitely many points. \todo{Wrong!}

Here we used the fact that $k$ is infinite given it's algebraically closed.

\subsection{}

See the first post!
Closed subset of product topology on $\mathbb A^1\times \mathbb A^1$ can be uncountable, for example, a line $\{(x_0,y)\in\mathbb A^1\times A^1 ~\mid~ y\in k\}$ where $x_0\in k$ is fixed would be closed. But it's uncountable. 

The reason why $\Delta$ is closed in Zariski topology of $\mathbb A^2$ is correct. 

For product topology, the reason why it's not closed is because Zariski topology on $\mathbb A^1$ is not Hausdorff, by a lemma we mentioned we know $\Delta$ isn't closed. \todo{Verified!}

\section{Exercise 1.7.}

\subsection{(a)}

(i) $\Rightarrow$ (ii) and (iii) $\Rightarrow$ (iv): Zorn's Lemma.

(ii) $\Rightarrow$ (i) and (iv) $\Rightarrow$ (iii): contrapositive, with Axiom of Dependent Choice.

(i) $\Leftrightarrow$ (iii): taking complement.

\subsection{(b)}

A similar statement is Exercise 17. (v) of \cite{atiyah1994introduction}, which states that $\operatorname{Spec}A$ is quasi-compact for a ring $A$.

For a given open cover of $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ of $X$, we can throw away open subset $U_i$ such that $U_i\subset U_j$ for some $j\in I$. Here $I$ is some index set.
So we can assume in this open cover, we don't have $U_i\subset U_j$ for any $i,j\in I$.
Then we have a ascending chain of open subsets 
\[U_i\subseteq U_i\cup U_j \subseteq\cdots.\]
Noetherian condition imposed gives us finitely many index, and they form a finite subcover as expected.

\subsubsection{}

A very simple proof \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1442665/a-noetherian-topological-space-is-compact}{HERE} used maximality property.

A stronger statement \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2745543/v-is-noetherian-space-if-only-if-every-open-subset-of-v-is-compact}{HERE}.

\section{Exercise 1.10.}

\subsection{(a)}

Clear, since any chain of $Y$ is also a chain in $X$, and we use property of sup mentioned on Prop 2.8. of \href{https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/m125b/ch2.pdf}{HERE}.

Example in topological space is actually easier to say than Nagata's example.

Take our topological space as $X=[0,1]\subset\mathbb R$. And define the topology by declaring all closed subsets as
\[\{\emptyset,X,\{[1/n,1]\subset \mathbb R~\mid~ i\geq 2, i\in\mathbb Z\}\}.\]
Clearly we can check it satisfies infinite intersection and finite union axiom.

It's Noetherian for any descending chain of closed subsets must terminate. 

It's of infinite Krull dimension. For any $n>0$, we can construct a chain of such length. Hence the dimension, defined as supremum cannot be finite.

Another weird example could be found \href{https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT4210/v18/mat4210notes5.pdf}{HERE}, in which we give $\mathbb N$ the topology empty set, entire space, and $\{x\in\mathbb N ~\mid~ x\geq q\}$ for some $a\in \mathbb N$.
