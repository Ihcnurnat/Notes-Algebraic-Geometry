\section{Definition: Ringed Space}

\subsection{Local Homomorphism}

The map $\mathscr F^{\sharp}_P$ is defined in Rising Sea's Exercise 2.2.I., PUSHFORWARD INDUCES MAPS OF STALKS.

The condition $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak m_B)=\mathfrak m_A$ has equivalent definitions by Lemma \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/07BH}{07BJ} on Stacks Project.

Here is an example of ring homomorphism between local rings that's not a local homomorphism, see a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3752503/example-of-non-local-homomorphism-on-local-rings}{HERE}.

\section{Proposition 2.2.}

\subsection{(b)}

Notice that the map $\psi$ is clearly well-defined.
For $a/f^n=b/f^m$ for some integers $m,n$, the maps is defined as 
\begin{align*}
    \psi:A_f &\to \mathcal O(D(f))\\
    a/f^n &\mapsto s: D(f)\to\prod_{\mathfrak p\in D(f)}A_{\mathfrak p}
\end{align*}where $s(\mathfrak p):=a/f^n\in A_{\mathfrak p}$. Substituting $b/f^m$ into $a/f^n$ will not change the value of the map, therefore it's independent of the choice of representative.

Why it's not affine? See this \href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/87480/explanation-on-a-scheme-which-is-not-affine-scheme}{POST} and a detailed \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4281800/example-of-scheme-which-is-not-an-affine-scheme}{POST}. 

Some arguments heavily rely on \textit{separated}.

\section{Proj S: Homogeneous Spectrum}

\subsection{Homogeneous}

See this \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4027174/homogeneous-ideal-in-kx-0-x-n}{POST} for equivalent definitions of homogeneous prime ideal. 

According to \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00JM}{Tag 00JM}, we have

\textit{To check that a homogeneous ideal $\mathfrak p$ is prime it suffices to check that $\star$ if $ab\in \mathfrak p$ with $a,b$ homogeneous then either $a\in \mathfrak p$ or $b\in \mathfrak p$.}

Say $A,B$ are two elements in the graded ring $S$ such that $AB\in \mathfrak p$, which is assumed to be homogeneous prime. We assume the assumption of $\star$ and we wish to show $A\in\mathfrak p$ or $B\in\mathfrak p$. First of all, we can decompose the elements 
\[A=\sum_{1\leq i\leq n} a_i, B=\sum_{1\leq j\leq m}b_j\] where $a_i\in S_i, b_j\in S_j$ and $n,m$ are some integers. Suppose the assumption $\star$ holds for arbitrary pair of $(a_i,b_j)$, it will implies their sum $A\in \mathfrak p$ or $B\in...$. 

\section{Proposition 2.5.}

\subsection{(a)}

\subsection{(b)}

Notice that when defining homogeneous spectrum, we excluded those homenegeous prime ideal that contains $S_+$. This is because we wish to cover $\operatorname{Proj}S$ with $D_+(f)$. We need to prove the non-trivial inclusion 
\[\operatorname{Proj}S\subset \bigcup_{f\in S_+\cap S^h}D_+(f).\]
Pick an element from LHS, i.e. a homogeneous prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ such that $S_+\not\subset \mathfrak p$. Hence there exists some $f\in S_+$ such that $f'\notin \mathfrak p$, then we can pick a homogeneous part $f:=f'\cap S^h$ such that $f_0\notin \mathfrak p$. This gives us 
\[\mathfrak p\in D_+(f_0).\]
And this proves the desired inclusion, with the converse inclusion apparently holds, we can conclude 
\[\{D_+(f)\}_{f\in S_+\cap S^h}\] is an open covering of homogeneous spectrum $\operatorname{Proj}S$.

\section{Exercise 2.3.}
\textit{\textbf{Reduced Schemes}. A scheme $(X,\mathcal O_X)$ is \textbf{reduced} if for every open set $U\subset X$, the ring $\mathcal O_X(U)$ has no nilpotent elements.}

\subsection{(a)}

\begin{proof}
    $\Leftarrow$:
    We can express the stalk as a filtered colimit 
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal O_{X,P}
        =&~ \operatorname{colim}_{P\in U}\mathcal O_X(U).
    \end{align*} where each $\mathcal O_X(U)$ is assumed to be reduced. 
    And I claim colimit of reduced ring is again reduced \todo{?}:
    Suppose it has a nilpotent element $a\in\mathcal O_{X,P}$, then there exists some $(U,a)\in \mathcal O_X(U)$ such that $a$ is the image of $(U,a)$ under colimit map $\varphi$ which is a ring homomorphism. Then we have $(U,a)^n$ for some integer $n$ will be mapped to $0$ in the stalk $\mathcal O_{X,P}$. By \cite{altman2013term} Corollary 7.5. (c), there exists some $\mathcal O_X(V)$ for $V\subset U$ such that the image of $(U,a)^n$ will be mapped to $0$ under a transition map $\rho_{UV}$, hence $\rho_{UV}((U,a))^n=0\in\mathcal O_X(V)$, which forces $\rho_{UV}((U,a))=0$ given ring $\mathcal O_X(V)$ is reduced. By commutativity, we have $a$, being an image of $\rho_{UV}((U,a))$, equals to $0$. 

    $\Rightarrow$: 
    See Lemma 01J1 of \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01IZ}{Tag 01IZ}. 
    Pick a section $f\in\mathcal O_X(U)$ such that $f^n=0$ for some integer $n$. 
    Consider the ring homomorphism $O_X(U)\to O_{X,P}$, which will map $f$ to a nilpotent in $O_{X,P}$ that we assumed to be reduced. While $P\in U$ is arbitrary, then $f$ will be mapped to $0$ under injective map 
    \[O_X(U)\to \prod_{P\in U}O_{X,P}.\] This forces $f=0$ as $\mathcal O_X$ is a sheaf.
\end{proof} 

\subsection{Failed Attempt of (b)}
The reduced scheme $(X,(\mathcal O_X)_{\text{red}})$ is indeed a scheme. For every point $P\in X$, there exists an open subset $U$ such that $(U,\mathcal O_X\vert_U)\simeq (\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal O_{\operatorname{Spec}A})$.

To define a morphism from $X_{\text{red}}\to X$, we take identity $\operatorname{id}:\operatorname{sp}(X_{\text{red}})\to\operatorname{sp}(X)$ as the homeomorphism between the underlying topological spaces. It remains to define a morphism of sheaves from 
\[f^{\sharp}:\mathcal O_X\to\operatorname{id}_{\ast}(\mathcal O_X)_{\text{red}}=:\mathcal G\] such that $f^{\sharp}_P:\mathcal O_{X,P}\to \mathcal G_P$ is a local ring homomorphism. 

Fix an open subset $U\subset X$, we define $f^{\sharp}(U)$ as 
\begin{align*}
    f^{\sharp}(U):\mathcal O_X(U)\to\mathcal G(U)=\operatorname{id}_{\ast}(\mathcal O_X)_{\text{red}}(U)=\mathcal O_{\text{red}}(U)
\end{align*}

\section{Exercise 2.4.}

Isn't this a direct application of Proposition 2.3. \cite{hartshorne2013algebraic}? 

\section{Exercise 2.12.}

\subsection{Remarks}

Notice that in order to be defined, the diagram of morphism $\varphi_{ik}=\varphi_{jk}\circ\varphi_{ij}$ admits a diagram as in \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01JA}{Tag 01JA}.

See Rising Sea Exercise 4.4.A. \Cref{4.4.A.}, in fact the inverse condition given as (1) and identity are redundent.

\section{Exercise 2.13.}\label{Hart Chap 2 Ex 2.13.}

\subsection{(a)}

$\Leftarrow$: In particular, the space $X$ is quasi-compact. For any ascending chain of open subsets, they form an open covering of $X$, hence we can reduce to finite many of them. Take the largest one open set $U_0$, the chain will terminate there. 

$\Rightarrow$: Fix an open subset $U$ with an opne covering $\{U_i\}_{i\in I}$ where $I$ is an index set. It must reduce to finite sub-cover otherwise we can form an (strictly) ascending chain of open subsets in $U$, hence in $X$, which contradicts the fact that $X$ is Noetherian. 

\subsection{(b)}

For space $\operatorname{sp}(X)$ is quasi-compact see Atiyah's Exercise in Chapter 1. 

Example of an affine scheme $X$ whose underlying space $\operatorname{sp}(X)$ is not Noetherian: 
\[\operatorname{Spec}k[x_1,x_2,x_3,...]\] because we have infinitely descending chain of closed subsets, which corresponds to infinitely ascending ideals. \todo{?}
