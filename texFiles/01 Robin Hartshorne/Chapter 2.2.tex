\section{Definition: Ringed Space}

\subsection{Local Homomorphism}

The map $\mathscr F^{\sharp}_P$ is defined in Rising Sea's Exercise 2.2.I., PUSHFORWARD INDUCES MAPS OF STALKS.

The condition $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak m_B)=\mathfrak m_A$ has equivalent definitions by Lemma \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/07BH}{07BJ} on Stacks Project.

Here is an example of ring homomorphism between local rings that's not a local homomorphism, see a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3752503/example-of-non-local-homomorphism-on-local-rings}{HERE}.
