\section{Definition: Ringed Space}

\subsection{Local Homomorphism}

The map $\mathscr F^{\sharp}_P$ is defined in Rising Sea's Exercise 2.2.I., PUSHFORWARD INDUCES MAPS OF STALKS.

The condition $\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak m_B)=\mathfrak m_A$ has equivalent definitions by Lemma \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/07BH}{07BJ} on Stacks Project.

Here is an example of ring homomorphism between local rings that's not a local homomorphism, see a post \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3752503/example-of-non-local-homomorphism-on-local-rings}{HERE}.

\section{Proposition 2.2.}

\subsection{(b)}

Notice that the map $\psi$ is clearly well-defined.
For $a/f^n=b/f^m$ for some integers $m,n$, the maps is defined as 
\begin{align*}
    \psi:A_f &\to \mathcal O(D(f))\\
    a/f^n &\mapsto s: D(f)\to\prod_{\mathfrak p\in D(f)}A_{\mathfrak p}
\end{align*}where $s(\mathfrak p):=a/f^n\in A_{\mathfrak p}$. Substituting $b/f^m$ into $a/f^n$ will not change the value of the map, therefore it's independent of the choice of representative.

\section{Example 2.3.6.}

Why it's not affine? See this \href{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/87480/explanation-on-a-scheme-which-is-not-affine-scheme}{POST} and a detailed \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4281800/example-of-scheme-which-is-not-an-affine-scheme}{POST}. 

Some arguments heavily rely on \textit{separated}.

\section{Proj S: Homogeneous Spectrum}

\subsection{Homogeneous}

See this \href{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4027174/homogeneous-ideal-in-kx-0-x-n}{POST} for equivalent definitions of homogeneous prime ideal. 

According to \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00JM}{Tag 00JM}, we have

\textit{To check that a homogeneous ideal $\mathfrak p$ is prime it suffices to check that $\star$ if $ab\in \mathfrak p$ with $a,b$ homogeneous then either $a\in \mathfrak p$ or $b\in \mathfrak p$.}

Say $A,B$ are two elements in the graded ring $S$ such that $AB\in \mathfrak p$, which is assumed to be homogeneous prime. We assume the assumption of $\star$ and we wish to show $A\in\mathfrak p$ or $B\in\mathfrak p$. First of all, we can decompose the elements 
\[A=\sum_{1\leq i\leq n} a_i, B=\sum_{1\leq j\leq m}b_j\] where $a_i\in S_i, b_j\in S_j$ and $n,m$ are some integers. Suppose the assumption $\star$ holds for arbitrary pair of $(a_i,b_j)$, it will implies their sum $A\in \mathfrak p$ or $B\in...$. 

\section{Proposition 2.5.}

\subsection{(a)}

\subsection{(b)}

Notice that when defining homogeneous spectrum, we excluded those homenegeous prime ideal that contains $S_+$. This is because we wish to cover $\operatorname{Proj}S$ with $D_+(f)$. We need to prove the non-trivial inclusion 
\[\operatorname{Proj}S\subset \bigcup_{f\in S_+\cap S^h}D_+(f).\]
Pick an element from LHS, i.e. a homogeneous prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ such that $S_+\not\subset \mathfrak p$. Hence there exists some $f\in S_+$ such that $f'\notin \mathfrak p$, then we can pick a homogeneous part $f:=f'\cap S^h$ such that $f_0\notin \mathfrak p$. This gives us 
\[\mathfrak p\in D_+(f_0).\]
And this proves the desired inclusion, with the converse inclusion apparently holds, we can conclude 
\[\{D_+(f)\}_{f\in S_+\cap S^h}\] is an open covering of homogeneous spectrum $\operatorname{Proj}S$.

\section{Exercise 2.3.}
\textit{\textbf{Reduced Schemes}. A scheme $(X,\mathcal O_X)$ is \textbf{reduced} if for every open set $U\subset X$, the ring $\mathcal O_X(U)$ has no nilpotent elements.}

\subsection{(a)}

\begin{proof}
    We can express the stalk as a filtered colimit 
    \begin{align*}
        \mathcal O_{X,P}
        =&~ \operatorname{colim}_{P\in U}\mathcal O_X(U).
    \end{align*} where each $\mathcal O_X(U)$ is assumed to be reduced. 
    And I claim colimit of reduced ring is again reduced \todo{?}:
    Suppose it has a nilpotent element $a\in\mathcal O_{X,P}$, then there exists some $(U,a)\in \mathcal O_X(U)$ such that $a$ is the image of $(U,a)$ under colimit map $\varphi$ which is a ring homomorphism. Then we have $(U,a)^n$ for some integer $n$ will be mapped to $0$ in the stalk $\mathcal O_{X,P}$. By \cite{altman2013term} Corollary 7.5. (c), there exists some $\mathcal O_X(V)$ for $V\subset U$ such that the image of $(U,a)^n$ will be mapped to $0$ under a transition map $\rho_{UV}$, hence $\rho_{UV}((U,a))^n=0\in\mathcal O_X(V)$, which forces $\rho_{UV}((U,a))=0$ given ring $\mathcal O_X(V)$ is reduced. By commutativity, we have $a$, being an image of $\rho_{UV}((U,a))$, equals to $0$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Exercise 2.12.}

\subsection{Remarks}

Notice that in order to be defined, the diagram of morphism $\varphi_{ik}=\varphi_{jk}\circ\varphi_{ij}$ admits a diagram as in \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01JA}{Tag 01JA}.

See Rising Sea Exercise 4.4.A. \Cref{4.4.A.}, in fact the inverse condition given as (1) and identity are redundent.
