Assume $s_x=0$, while in Category of Abelian groups the homomorphism is exactly group homomorphism. So there must exist some $U_x$ such that $s\mid_{U_x}=0$ as a pre-image of $s_x$.

\subsection{(b)}

For the proof of isomorphism, it implicitly used Corollary 7.5 of \cite{atiyah1994introduction}.

\section{Lemma 3.35.}

\subsection{(a)}

Take $n$ to be the largest index such that $a_n\notin I^h$, and choose $b_m$ similarly. They must exist for $a\notin I^h$ by assumption.
And in general, if we have $a\notin I^h$, we can always subtract all homogeneous part in the tail of $a$ to get a new $a'$. And denote $a'=a$.
