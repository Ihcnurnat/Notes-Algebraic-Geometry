\section{Exercise 2.11.}

\subsection{(a)}

Pick $a,b\in X$ such that $u(a)=u(b)$. We wish to prove $a=b$. 

By \cite{altman2013term} Corollary 7.5. (1), the element $u(a)\in Y$ admits some $l\in I$ such that there exists $y\in Y_l$ such that \[\beta_l(y)=u(a).\]
Suppose $l\geq i$, then we're done by diagram chase.
Suppose $l<i$, by commutativity of the diagram we can map the element $y$ under $\beta_{li}:Y_l\to Y_i$. And then apply a diagram chase argument. 

\subsection{(b)}

Pick an element $y\in Y$. It corresponds to some element $Y_l$ for some $l$ by Corollary 7.5. (1), map it to $Y_i$ if necessary. Then apply diagram chase because we know at least $u_i$ is surjective.
